# Motuiti

Motuiti is an app that displays, for a given ISBN, bookshops that have the
corresponding book available in stock on a map with geolocation.

Book availability informations are updated once a day from french independant
bookstores portal [Place des libraires](https://www.placedeslibraires.fr/).

# TODO

- Have some kind of spinner on map while searching
- Handle errors in front & back ends
- Handle fetching errors
- Google Analytics
- Add welcome message
- Wait for Google Maps to load before loading app
- Prefill search input when url param changes

## Nice to have

- Tooltips

- Show numbers of bookstores results after search
- Regroup map markers into clusters
- Increase map markers z-index on hover
- "Call" and "Directions" buttons
- React components test
- PropTypes
